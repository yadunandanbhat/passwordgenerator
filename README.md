# Password Generator

My current idea is to develop a web app based on html, css and js, that can generate a password which meets the user requirements.
I am basing this idea on [bitwarden's password generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/).

I am also doing this project to learn basics of web development like setting up and configuring a js based project environment, developing the code using best practices and then hosting the project.

To generate password, I'm thinking of using arrays and select random based on the choice of the user and then shuffle the given string to remove patterns and then print it in the site.
