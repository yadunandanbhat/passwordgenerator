#Password Generator
My current idea is to develop a web app based on html, css and js, that can generate a password which meets the user requirements.
I am basing this idea on [bitwarden's password generator] (https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/).

I am also doing this project to learn basics of web development like setting up and configuring a js based project environment, developing the code using best practices and then hosting the project.
